Erechtheus, son of Pandion, had four daughters. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but was defeated. Neptune, angry because his son was killed by Erechtheus, said "A daughter of Erechtheus will be sacrificed." Therefore, Chthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrificed. The remaining sisters killed themselves; Erechtheus struck himself with a lightning bolt.
