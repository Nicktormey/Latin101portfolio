C.  

Erechtheus, son of Pandion, had four daughters. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but was defeated. Neptune, angry because his son was killed by Erechtheus, said "A daughter of Erechtheus is to be sacrificed." 
Therefore, Chthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrificed. The remaining sisters killed themselves;
Erechtheus himself was struck by lightning bolt.
