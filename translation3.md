Erechtheus, son of Pandion, had four daughters. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but was defeated. Neptune, angry because his son was killed by Erechtheus, said "A daughter of Erechtheus will be sacrificed."  (**This is not a future tense statement.  What idea does the gerundive convey?**)

Therefore, Chthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrificed. The remaining sisters killed themselves;
Erechtheus struck himself with a lightning bolt. (**What voice is the verb?**)
