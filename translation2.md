Long ago, Prometheus, first son of Iapetus, fashioned humans out of mud. At the same time, Vulcan made a woman from mud. Minerva gave a soul to this woman and all the gods sent her gifts. Because of this, her name was "Pandora". Pandora was given into marriage to Epimetheus by Jupiter. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
