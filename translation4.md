Cum *Achīvī* decem annōs Troiam capere nōn **possent**, *Epeus* equum mirae magnitūdinis ligneum **fēcit**. In *eō* **collēctī** sunt Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus. et in *equō* **scripsērunt** “DANAI MINERVAE DONUM DANT”, castraque transtulērunt Tenedo. Cum id *Troianī* **vidērunt**, **arbitratī sunt** hostēs abisse; *Priamus* **imperāvit** equum in templum Minervae **ducī**. Cum **vātēs**, Cassandra, **diceret** *equum* habere hostes, fidēs eī data non est et *equum* pro templō **posuērunt**. *Achīvī* **exiērunt** portārumque custodēs **occidērunt** et *Troiam* **sunt potitī**.  
B.  
1. *decem annōs* is in the accusative case because 
2. *possent* is third person, plural, imperfect, subjunctive, and active. It is in the active mood because the Greeks were actively trying and failing to take Troy
3. DANAI is the subject, MINERVAE is the indirect object, DONUM is the direct object, DANT is the verb
4. third person plural perfect passive indicative
5. 
6. *duci* present passive infinitive
7. *ei* is dative and it serves as a pronoun that replaces Cassandra
8. The *que* means "and" - it links exiting the gates with killing the guards. 

C.  
For 10 years, the Greeks could not take Troy, so Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. He gathered Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus inside. And in the horse was written "The Greeks offer this gift to Minerva", it is brought through the millitary camp in Tenedos. When the Trojans saw it, they judged it as an enemy; Priam orders the horse to be lead into the temple of Minerva. When the prophet, Cassandra, says that the horse contains enemies, there is no faith in her. The Greeks exit to the gates, kill the guards, and Troy is conquered.
